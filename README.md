ADVERTISING SALES PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING

Sales prediction means predicting how much of a product people will buy based on factors such as the amount you spend to advertise your product, the segment of people you advertise for, or the platform you are advertising on about your product.
This is important so as to predict their future sales with every step they take to manipulate the cost of advertising their product. This is the task of sales prediction with machine learning using Python.
